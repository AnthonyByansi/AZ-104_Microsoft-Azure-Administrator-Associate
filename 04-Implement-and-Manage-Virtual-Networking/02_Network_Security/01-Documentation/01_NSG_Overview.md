# Network Security Groups (NSGs) Overview

Network Security Groups (NSGs) are a fundamental feature in Azure that allows you to control inbound and outbound traffic to your virtual network resources. They function as virtual firewalls that protect your Azure environment.

## Key Features
- **Inbound and Outbound Rules**: Control access to VMs and services.
- **Prioritized Rules**: Rule evaluation is sequential by priority.
- **Service Tags and Application Security Groups (ASGs)**: Simplify rule management.
