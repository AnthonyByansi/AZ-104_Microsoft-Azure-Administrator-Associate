# Virtual Network (VNet) Overview

## What is a Virtual Network?
Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is a key building block for private networks in Azure. It enables many types of Azure resources, such as virtual machines (VMs), to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks.

## Features of VNets
- **Isolation and Segmentation**: Fully isolate your network.
- **Subnets**: Break down your VNet into smaller networks.
- **Security**: Leverage Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Azure Firewall.
- **Hybrid Networking**: Extend your on-premises network with VPN or ExpressRoute.

## Use Cases
- Hosting web applications in a secure environment.
- Extending on-premises environments into Azure.
- Setting up development and testing environments.
